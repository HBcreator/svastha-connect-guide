### Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What is the minimum recommended stay?**

For our wellness and rejuvenation programs, we recommend a minimum stay of 7 days. For our medical treatment programs, a stay of 14 to 21 days is typically required for deep and effective healing, as advised by our physicians.

**2. What is the accommodation like? Is it a luxury resort?**

Our focus is 100% on your healing, not on luxury frills. We offer a range of clean, comfortable, and well-appointed rooms, including premium backwater-facing cottages. We are a genuine healing hospital, not a 5-star hotel, which allows us to keep our focus entirely on your therapeutic outcome.

**3. What does your 300-year heritage mean for my treatment?**

It means your treatment is not based on theory, but on a living legacy of healing wisdom passed down through generations. Our physicians have an intuitive and profound understanding of Ayurveda that can only come from this deep-rooted heritage, ensuring your care is both authentic and exceptionally effective.

**4. What kind of food is served?**

We serve a simple, wholesome, and delicious vegetarian diet based on classical Ayurvedic principles. Your meals are considered a vital part of your treatment and are customized by our physicians to suit your unique *dosha* and health condition.

**5. Should I bring my regular medications with me?**

Yes, absolutely. It is crucial that you bring any prescribed medications you are currently taking, along with the relevant prescriptions. Our Ayurvedic physicians will review them during your initial consultation and advise you on how to manage them during your stay.

**6. How do I get to the centre?**

We are located in Kayamkulam, in the beautiful Alappuzha district of Kerala. We are accessible from both Trivandrum (TRV) and Cochin (COK) International Airports. We are happy to help you coordinate your airport transfers for a seamless and stress-free journey.

**7. Are the treatments personalized for me?**

**8. Can a companion who is not taking treatment stay with me?**

Yes, companions are welcome to stay with you. They can enjoy the serene backwater environment and our healthy Ayurvedic cuisine. Please note that treatments are only provided to those who have undergone a consultation and have a prescribed wellness plan.

**9. What is the significance of the "Green Leaf" certification?**

The 'Green Leaf' certification is the highest honor for authenticity awarded by the Government of Kerala's Department of Tourism. It is your guarantee that you are receiving the most traditional, high-quality, and authentic Ayurvedic care, which is the cornerstone of our philosophy.

**10. What should I pack for my stay?**

We recommend packing light, comfortable cotton clothing suitable for a warm climate and for wearing during yoga sessions. Please also bring any personal toiletries, your medical records, and a good book. We will provide towels and any necessary attire for your treatments.
