### Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What is the minimum recommended stay?**

For our wellness and rejuvenation programs, we recommend a minimum stay of 7 days to experience tangible benefits. For our medical treatment programs, a stay of 14 days or more is typically required for deep and effective healing, as advised by our physicians.

**2. What is the accommodation like? Is it a luxury resort?**

Our focus is 100% on your healing, not on luxury frills. Our accommodations are simple, clean, comfortable, and well-furnished, designed to provide a peaceful environment for rest. We are a genuine healing sanctuary, not a 5-star hotel, which allows us to keep our focus entirely on your therapeutic outcome.

**3. What kind of food is served?**

We serve a simple, wholesome, and delicious vegetarian diet based on classical Ayurvedic principles. Your meals are considered a vital part of your treatment and are customized by our physicians to suit your unique *dosha* and health condition.

**4. Should I bring my regular medications with me?**

Yes, absolutely. It is crucial that you bring any prescribed medications you are currently taking, along with the relevant prescriptions. Our Ayurvedic physicians will review them during your initial consultation and advise you on how to manage them during your stay.

**5. How do I get to the retreat?**

Our retreat is located in the serene hills of Idukki, Kerala, a scenic journey from the Cochin International Airport (COK). We are happy to help you coordinate your airport transfers and other transportation arrangements for a seamless and stress-free journey.

**6. What should I pack for my stay?**

We recommend packing light, comfortable cotton clothing suitable for a warm climate and for wearing during yoga sessions. Please also bring any personal toiletries, your medical records, and a good book. We will provide towels and any necessary attire for your treatments.

**7. Are the treatments really personalized?**

Yes, completely. There are no one-size-fits-all packages here. Following your comprehensive initial consultation with our fourth-generation physicians, your entire treatment plan—from therapies to diet—is crafted exclusively for you and is adjusted daily based on your progress.

**8. Can a companion who is not taking treatment stay with me?**

Yes, companions are welcome to stay with you. They can enjoy the serene environment and our healthy Ayurvedic cuisine. Please note that treatments are only provided to those who have undergone a consultation and have a prescribed wellness plan.

**9. What does "healing over frills" mean in practice?**

It means that every resource, every decision, and every moment at our retreat is dedicated to your therapeutic outcome. We invest in experienced, fourth-generation doctors and high-quality treatments rather than on spa-like amenities, creating a sincere and focused environment for those who are serious about their health.

**10. Is the retreat suitable for elderly patients?**

Yes, we offer compassionate and specialized care for our senior guests. Our physicians are experienced in designing gentle yet effective programs for age-related conditions, and our calm, supportive environment is ideal for their healing and comfort.
