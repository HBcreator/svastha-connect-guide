### Frequently Asked Questions About Dheemahi Ayurvedic Centre

**1. What is the minimum duration for treatment programs at Dheemahi?**

The ideal treatment duration depends on specific health conditions and wellness goals. For most conditions including back pain, stress management, and PCOD, the recommended duration is three weeks (21 days) with follow-up medication for 3-6 months. For sustainable weight loss programs, the ideal duration extends to three to six weeks for optimal long-term results. Weekend or short stays under two weeks may provide relaxation benefits but insufficient time for substantial therapeutic transformation addressing root causes.

**2. How does Dheemahi differ from luxury Ayurvedic resorts?**

Dheemahi is an honest-to-goodness Ayurvedic medical treatment facility, not a spa resort. The center eschews bells and whistles typically expected at luxury wellness resorts - no elaborate swimming pools, saunas, gyms, or extraneous amenities. The sole focus remains firmly on authentic healing through personalized medical treatment rather than hospitality frills. Rooms are simple, clean, and functional with basic necessities. This no-nonsense approach attracts serious healing seekers valuing therapeutic outcomes over resort comforts.

**3. Which location should I choose - Kumarakom Village or Kottayam City?**

Choose Dheemahi Ayurvedic Village in Kumarakom if you seek complete immersion in Kerala countryside charm with serene backwater lake views, proximity to famous Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary, peaceful village atmosphere, and nature connection enhancing healing. Choose Dheemahi Neelimangalam in Kottayam city center if you prefer urban convenience, easier accessibility, or cannot travel to remote locations. Both facilities maintain identical treatment quality, medical expertise, and therapeutic standards under the same management and medical team.

**4. Are treatments really personalized or are they standardized packages?**

Dheemahi genuinely provides completely personalized treatment protocols, not standardized packages. Doctors perform thorough assessment suggesting only treatments your body can accept based on individual constitution and health status. Daily medical evaluations allow treatments to be tweaked continuously depending on your body's response, creating truly customized therapeutic regimes. This personalized approach distinguishes Dheemahi from facilities applying generic treatment packages regardless of individual patient needs.

**5. What can I expect regarding food and dietary restrictions?**

Dheemahi serves three simple, wholesome vegetarian meals daily based on Ayurvedic nutritional principles - breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 1:00 PM, dinner at 7:00 PM (timings may vary based on treatment schedules). Food is predominantly Kerala cuisine prepared without heavy spices, emphasizing digestibility and medicinal value. Seasonal fruits or rice porridge available between meals if hungry. Herbal water is standard drink with meals. The food may seem bland initially but serves therapeutic purpose supporting healing processes rather than providing culinary entertainment.

**6. How much do treatments cost and is Dheemahi affordable?**

Dheemahi is recognized as one of the most affordable authentic Ayurveda centers in Kerala without compromising treatment quality. All-inclusive packages start at INR 5,000 per day covering accommodation, three meals, treatments, yoga sessions, and doctor consultations. Pricing remains minimal compared to luxury Ayurvedic resorts charging significantly higher rates. The family management prioritizes making healing accessible rather than maximizing profits, creating excellent value for serious patients seeking authentic treatment within reasonable budgets.

**7. What about yoga and daily schedule?**

Yoga is practiced daily except Sundays, typically held in the evening at 5:00 PM, conducted by expert yoga master (Mr. Parameshwaran mentioned frequently). Group sessions lasting approximately one hour include asanas and pranayama. Some packages include additional yoga sessions. Both indoor and outdoor yoga spaces available, with the beautiful balcony facing sunrise being particularly pleasant for morning practice. Daily schedule revolves around treatment timings, meals, yoga sessions, doctor consultations, and ample rest time for body to process therapies.

**8. Can Dheemahi help with my specific condition?**

Dheemahi's unique approach involves thorough pre-arrival discussions ensuring realistic matching of patient expectations with their therapeutic capabilities. With years of experience, the team honestly communicates if certain conditions may not be suitable for their system, sometimes advising patients when other medical approaches might be more appropriate. This integrity-based consultation helps patients make informed healthcare decisions. Contact the center with your medical reports and health concerns for honest assessment of whether Dheemahi can effectively address your specific condition.
