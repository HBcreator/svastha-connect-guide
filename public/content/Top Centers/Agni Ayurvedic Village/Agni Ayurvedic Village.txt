### Our Pillars of Wellness

Our approach to healing is built on four pillars of ancient wisdom, each tailored to your specific needs.

**Ayurveda & Panchakarma**
This is the soul of Agni. We practice classical Kerala-style Ayurveda and offer authentic *Panchakarma*—the ultimate detoxification therapy—to eliminate deep-seated toxins, restore your *dosha* balance, and rejuvenate your entire system.

**Yoga & Pranayama**
Led by our experienced instructors, our three daily yoga sessions are designed to perfectly complement your Ayurvedic treatments. From energizing morning practices to relaxing evening sessions, we help you unite your mind, body, and spirit.

**Meditation**
Daily guided meditation is an essential part of the healing process at Agni. We teach various techniques to help you calm your nervous system, reduce stress, and cultivate a profound sense of inner peace.

Your journey to renewed health begins with a single step. Contact Svastha Global to connect with the best of authentic *Ayurveda* in India.
