*"No Words Can Describe the Impact - Lost 6kg in 28 Days!"*

There are no words that can describe the impact and value of treatments from Somatheeram's Ayurveda therapists. In 28 days, I lost 6 kilograms through their authentic slimming package. The quality of care from Dr. Lal and medical team is beyond measure. The beautiful grounds made nature an integral part of my healing. The food was flavorful and surprisingly appealing. Yoga and meditation classes shifted my energy completely - I became more peaceful and centered. My therapists performed treatments with such skill. This wasn't just a retreat; it was a complete life transformation!

*"Third Visit - Most Fulfilling Yet!"*

This was my third stay at Somatheeram, and this 15-day retreat has been my most fulfilling visit yet. I left feeling completely rejuvenated and deeply impressed by consistent excellence and warm hospitality. Greeted with jasmine garland and fresh coconut water - such welcoming tradition. My cottage overlooked the magnificent Malabar Coast. Dr. Lal and Dr. Arpitha gave thorough health check-up and established my body-type for personalized therapy. The Body Purification Package was very restorative and re-energizing. Already reserved my room for next year with extended 21-day stay!

*"First Time Experience - Beyond All Expectations"*

Thank you for unforgettable moments! This was my first time at Somatheeram and all services were far beyond expectations. Staff from reception to gardeners made me feel welcome. Dr. Seena's detailed consultation with pulse diagnosis recognized my dosha type and prescribed personalized diet and treatment protocols. Every guest has two dedicated therapists. Special thanks to Ramadevi and Asha who made me feel like a Queen with their fantastic massages. Our special cottage had beautiful sea view. Somatheeram provides excellent treatments with authentic traditional methods!

*"Trained Ayurvedic Practitioner Impressed by Authenticity"*

My accommodation in finest Kerala architecture was absolutely perfect - location, cleanliness, bed quality all top level. As a trained Ayurvedic massage practitioner myself, I know what matters in authentic treatments, but Somatheeram puts the crown on everything I've experienced. The food was very fine, staff always friendly. Super addition - guests can also use pool and restaurant facilities of surrounding Somatheeram Group resorts including AyurSoma and Manaltheeram. Outstanding value and consistency!

Food quality and restaurant management were among the BEST we've experienced. The exceptional Ayurveda medical team led by experienced doctors was outstanding. Highly recommended for families!

*"It Was Amazing - Coming Back Every Year!"*

Amazing experience! First time here and I know with certainty I'll be coming back every year. Everything was great - traditional architecture, comfortable rooms with ocean views, delicious food, but most importantly - truly holistic approach addressing root causes rather than symptoms. Initial consultation thorough and insightful. Dr. Seena designed personalized treatment protocol. Daily treatments therapeutic and relaxing. Therapists skilled and caring. Yoga taught techniques I continue at home. Meditation brought mental peace. Everything contributed to deep healing. Life-changing experience!
