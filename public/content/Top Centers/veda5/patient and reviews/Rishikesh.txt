## **VEDA5 Rishikesh - Himalayan Healing Experiences**

**Review 1 - Deepika Singla,India**

*"Life-Changing Panchakarma in the Himalayas"*

Our family stayed at Veda5 in the summer. The check in experience was nice. However, they turned off electricity on one of the nights. We couldn’t sleep the whole night due to heat. Our intercom was off as there was no electricity. We were advised not to walk around at night. We were stranded and tried calling the reception for hours and they picked up after so many tries and finally turned on the electricity. The next day instead of being sorry, the owner of the place mentioned that it’s wrong of the booking websites to mention the stay as having a power backup. Overall the staff was amazing, food was good, but those 3-4 hours (12 am to 4 am) in heat, changed our whole experience to recommend this place any further.

*"From Rishikesh Overpriced Hotels to VEDA5 Paradise"*

After trying an overpriced four-star hotel in Rishikesh town, discovering VEDA5 was like finding heaven. Located 10 kilometers from the chaos in pristine mountains, this retreat offers genuine peace and authentic wellness. Gajendra Negi's yoga classes were phenomenal with personalized recommendations that deepened my practice significantly. Don't miss the cooking classes with Chef Devendra - one of the best chefs I've encountered! The food goes beyond delicious to genuinely healing. Three daily Satvik meals are included and I never wanted to eat elsewhere. My room had unobstructed Himalayan views, spotlessly clean with thoughtful amenities like thermosflasks of herbal tea. The spa treatments relieved stress I didn't know I carried. Staff friendliness is unmatched - everyone genuinely cares about your wellbeing. The peaceful corner with plants and waterfalls became my meditation spot. Come for as long as possible, ask for private yoga with Gajendra. Truly recreational!

*"Solo Female Traveler Felt Completely Safe"*

As a solo female traveler, safety was my primary concern when booking VEDA5 Rishikesh. From airport pickup as promised to departure, I felt completely secure and welcomed. The warm family feeling started immediately with traditional greeting bells and floral garlands. Accommodation was spacious with everything needed. The food exceeded expectations - healthy yet incredibly tasty. Yoga classes and Ayurvedic treatments hit the spot perfectly. Sonia and Ritika, the yoga teachers, became like sisters with their warm smiles, genuine love, and beautiful souls. I made wonderful friends among fellow guests. The location in the hills provides pristine air, stunning views, and easy 30-minute access to Rishikesh hub when desired. But honestly, I didn't want to leave! The excursion to Kunjapuri Temple for sunrise arranged by driver Dinesh Negi was spectacular. Treatment quality was exceptional, the Shirodhara particularly transformative. VEDA5 isn't just a retreat, it's a healing home. Highly recommended for solo travelers!

*"Second Visit Even Better Than First"*

This was my second visit to VEDA5 Rishikesh, and remarkably, the quality improved even more. Initially came with my sibling, this time solo, and staff remembered me! Before traveling, I worried if solo stay would be worthwhile, but it became one of my best solo trips ever. The entire VEDA5 family ensured I was attended to for all queries and concerns. The property sits beautifully in Neelkanth valley's lap. Sumptuous Satvik food, professional yoga classes, engaging social activities, and authentic Ayurvedic treatments elevate the experience tremendously. What truly stands out is exceptionally warm hospitality and staff always ready to help. During this visit, I was the only Indian visitor among international guests, yet the team made me feel included constantly. I made wonderful acquaintances during group activities. The treatments from therapist Ashish were phenomenal, and Sonia's Yoga Nidra sessions were deeply relaxing. Extended my stay another week - it was that needed and transformative!

*"Stunning Location with Smart Ayurvedic Doctor"*

VEDA5 is a stunning place just 25 minutes from Rishikesh, nestled in mountains surrounded by greenery. The property maintains incredibly high cleanliness and maintenance standards rare in India. The Ayurvedic diagnosis with the smart, excellent doctor was thorough and insightful using pulse diagnosis. He explained my Kapha imbalance clearly and prescribed accordingly. Massage treatments were best I've experienced - skilled, therapeutic, and deeply relaxing. The yoga teacher conducts practice every morning with precision and care. Great Ayurvedic food for those wanting silence and healing - no onion, no garlic, purely Satvik. The peaceful environment away from Rishikesh noise is perfect for wellness seekers. Room was comfortable with mountain views from private balcony. Staff professionalism combined with genuine warmth created perfect healing atmosphere. The meditation cave on property provides spiritual depth. Highly recommended for authentic Ayurvedic diagnosis and treatment!

*"Best Panchakarma Reset Experience"*

I stayed at VEDA5 Rishikesh for 21 nights from late February for complete Panchakarma detox, seeking a reset and sightseeing. My stay was AMAZING! From arrival, welcome bells ring and staff warmly receive you with blessings and gifts, creating immediate peace. Morning yoga and meditation with Yogi Gajendra Negi taught me patience with thoughts and strength in focus - great way starting each day. I booked private yoga classes with him for the last couple weeks, highly recommend deepening practice this way. The food - WOW! Chef Devendra, Chef Sajan, and team create incredible meals! Set with beautiful valley views, relaxing atmosphere, and the amazing Annam restaurant team (Abhvdav Singh, Anurag, Arti, Bal) made every meal enjoyable. The Panchakarma treatments were thorough and effective. Everyone I met from VEDA5 team was friendly and ensured everything went well. I've come home to Australia feeling very refreshed, energized, and renewed. The Himalayan setting enhances healing tremendously!

*"Made Us Younger by 10 Years!"*

My wife and I spent two incredible weeks at VEDA5 Rishikesh for rejuvenation package. All staff are supervised by Mr. Rahul Patil, truly a legend and captain! Regarding treatments, therapists Mrs. Neeraj, Mr. Luvprasad, and Mr. Rishabh are top professionals who made us younger at least 10 years! They are extended arms for Dr. Ravi Joshi, the main doctor radiating confidence and knowledge to solve almost any health problem. Yoga and meditation were real revelations. Mrs. Ira and Yogi Gajendra Negi are on another level entirely. Thanks to them, yoga and meditation will be important parts of our future life. Our driver and tour guide Mr. Dinesh Negi showed us Rishikesh in the most interesting way. The trip to Kunjapuri Temple to watch sunrise - WOW, what an experience! The food exceeded expectations, rooms were comfortable with Himalayan views, and the overall wellness approach was comprehensive. We left feeling rejuvenated, energized, and grateful!

*"Perfect Family Wellness Getaway"*

Visited VEDA5 Rishikesh with family for wellness adventure and it exceeded expectations. The facility is nestled in mountains with gorgeous sunrises and sunsets. Staff warmth and friendliness with very personalized service impressed us. From the moment you walk in, it's top-notch - the warm welcome from office staff, the ambiance, peacefulness, and nothing is too much trouble. Grounds are beautiful on the mountainside, rooms very comfortable and clean, view from our room breathtaking, with balcony to soak it all in. Front office staff Sanket, Akshay, and Kaushik were kind, welcoming, and efficient with any requests. Daily activities - yoga, meditation, and Ayurveda classes - were effectively communicated and always began on time. My wife and I had spa treatments that were incredible and fairly priced. Masseurs Ashish and Divya did wonderful jobs and were accommodating with preferences. My children enjoyed activities and the safe environment. Unforgettable family trip!

*"Spectacular Arrival and Heavenly Experience"*

Chosen VEDA5 for three nights as complete break from Rishikesh noise and activity. The arrival was beautiful with spectacular, dramatic welcome! Room was lovely, spacious, and comfortable with gorgeous balcony offering incredible valley views. Staff were wonderful and even made me a chocolate cake! Food on offer was delicious - though surprisingly abundant for a wellness retreat (I actually gained weight!). Did numerous spa treatments, and the doctor was wonderful, truly knowledgeable. A few comfort touches could improve therapist rooms, but therapists themselves were skilled. Daily yoga with Helena was fantastic, she also led a trek to nearby temple through simple village - sweet experience. The location away from city noise provides extremely peaceful environment. The service level, kind staff, professional approach made stay memorable. Highly recommended for those tired of noisy places seeking genuine relaxation. Worth every penny!

*"Home Away from Home in the Himalayas"*

My stay at VEDA5 Rishikesh with sisters was full of happy, lovely moments. Beautiful location without doubt, but the hosting truly made it special. All staff were supportive and helpful by nature. Specially Jitendra, Saurabh, Shashi, and Prashant - Jitendra was such a caring person. Chef made delicious homely Satvik food. Meditation and yoga with Swami ji and Helena, joining the Hawan - all were cherished, relaxing moments. Thank you Mr. Stuart for support and good package. Thanks Dr. Shuchita for health advice. Latha and Kusum gave excellent massage therapy. Have so many things to cherish at VEDA5. Choosing VEDA5 was one of my good decisions. Just feedback - if they could make few rooms without stairs, would be easier for elderly and sick people. Otherwise, everything was perfect. The peaceful valley location, clean rooms, authentic treatments, and caring staff created home away from home. Will definitely return!
