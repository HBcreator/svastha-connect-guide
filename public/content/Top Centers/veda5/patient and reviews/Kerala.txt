*"Autoimmune Condition Improved with Panchakarma"*

Veda5 Kerala is a slice of heaven. I booked last-minute hoping to receive Panchakarma for my autoimmune condition. As an Ayurveda student, I wanted to learn about treatment process. Lucky to find availability! My friend and I stayed 21 days - the most beautiful experience, especially as my first time in India. From start, greeted with love and warm energy from staff. You immediately feel how much attention and effort staff put into ensuring guests feel welcomed and safe. My room was upgraded to deluxe sea-view room - incredible! Porch to sit on with amazing sea views. Room was clean and spacious. Tindu put tremendous effort ensuring each day filled with activities and entertainment. Her bubbly personality and high energy made stay enjoyable. Dachu, the manager, was funny and full of life, teaching us Malayalam words daily. Every request taken seriously and ensured it happened. Movie nights, pujas, temple visits - this resort offers so much! I went in not knowing what to expect but received more than imagined. Sense of family here is special. Grateful for strong community, the land, and ancient medicine helping me regain strength!

*"21-Day Detox by the Ocean - Life Changing"*

We arrived at VEDA5 Kerala in early morning hours with staff car waiting at airport with water and fruit. The compound is 90 minutes from Kochi airport. Setting is superb, right on ocean with cool breezes blowing mosquitos away! We took detox treatment for 21 days. Doctor Nishanth provided consultation and therapy plan. Daily therapies were relaxing. My therapist Jily was friendly and efficient. Fellow guests are open to interaction, we had pleasant meals together. There's yoga and meditation, cooking classes, and Dr. Nishanth had regular talks about Ayurveda therapy. We enjoyed vegetarian meals and daily teatime. If looking for place to unwind in beautiful setting, this is it! All staff professional and friendly - gateman, Administration Dachu and staff, Yoga instructor Libin, housekeeping. The beach is pristine, clean, and just steps away. Treatments were authentic and effective. Doctors treated my back pain remarkably well. Stay exceeded expectations, left feeling renewed and energized!

*"Life-Changing Experience - Once in a Lifetime"*

I had the most amazing time at VEDA5 Kerala - truly life-changing. Dachu the manager was the loveliest person, arranging taxis for excursions we wanted. All staff fantastic and couldn't do enough for you. I honestly couldn't fault anything and highly recommend for anyone wanting yoga retreat in India. Resort situated in little fishing village. Local people so friendly and completely safe to go walks and explore. Food was fabulous, made fresh daily. Yoga and meditation by Libin was excellent. I learned so much and feel I came home a new person. Met amazing people I'll definitely keep in touch with. Will definitely return one day! Can't thank everyone at Veda5 enough for once-in-lifetime experience and beautiful memories I'll never forget. The beachfront location provided daily sunrise views, morning beach walks, and sunset meditations. Ayurvedic treatments were authentic and therapeutic. Felt completely taken care of like family. Transformative experience!

*"Perfect Beachside Ayurvedic Detox Center"*

Each human body deserves once yearly pure Ayurvedic living village experience. Perfect place to detox, pamper, relax and release life's tensions. Felt extremely relaxed. Dr. Nishant, Dachu, Vishnu were pros in consultation, hospitality, and management. Therapist Jilly ran her magic hands on me daily with different massages. May she be blessed with good health to serve more! Looking to relax and detox? Veda5 is combination of beachside resort and Ayurvedic detox center. Only complaint - management should take care of noises and construction during therapy time. Last three days had annoying continuous sounds during massage. Could have relaxed more without construction noises. Also, ensure guests don't carry cell phones into therapy rooms. Otherwise, beach was amazing, clean, peaceful. Very nice humble staff. Rooms spacious and clean. Food simple and Satvik. Home away from home. Tried yoga, meditation, Ayurveda massages - superb experience overall!

*"Peaceful Beach Retreat with Effective Treatments"*

After two years of COVID and stressful life, I visited VEDA5 Kerala for Panchakarma. Initial days when I started, I thought how it will be beneficial. After good five days of massages and treatment, I started feeling good and light! Doctor and therapist both very helpful, professional, and motivational. Food offered according to my treatment. Highly recommend this place for treatment, peaceful stay, and Panchakarma. Beach was awesome - clean and peaceful. Very nice humble staff. Rooms spacious and clean. Food simple and Satvik. Home away from home atmosphere. Tried yoga and meditation classes, Ayurveda massages - all superb. The wellness resort has small boutique property feel with humble staff. Drive from Kochi airport about 90 minutes through scenic Kerala countryside. Dream destination for anyone seeking authentic Ayurvedic healing combined with beach relaxation. Staff goes extra miles to make stay comfortable!

*"Solo Trip - Felt Safe and Supported"*

I was on solo trip and VEDA5 family organized taxi to pick me up at airport during night. As I arrived, introduced to kindest staff, always smiling and ready to help. Experience at VEDA5 is real and cozy. Treatments just amazing, especially Shirodhara. Food never boring, all veggie. Activities during day engaging but you can choose moment for yourself. We closed stay dancing together around fire on beach in front of property - magical! Truly wonderful experience. Hospitality warm and genuine. Therapies deeply healing. Overall care and attention went far beyond expectations. Every aspect from serene atmosphere to professional service reflected authenticity and excellence in Ayurveda. Grateful for rejuvenating and memorable stay! The experience of being here is amazing - beauty of place, human quality and charm of resort people whom I see as family already. Those Ayurvedas massages incredible! Small fishing village nearby provides authentic Kerala cultural experience!
