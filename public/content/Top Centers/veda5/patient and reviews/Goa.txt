## **VEDA5 Goa - Lakefront Tranquility & Wellness**

**Review 1 - Anna Kowalski, Warsaw, Poland**

*"Incredible Two-Week Experience Away from Hustle"*

We had incredible experience at VEDA5 Goa staying with my partner for two weeks. Away from hustle and bustle, it's an isle of calm and peace in Arambol. We loved every single thing, starting from furniture in our lake-faced cottage to the traditional Ayurvedic approach concept. Ayurvedic massages and treatments were excellent! The food - oh my God! Couldn't have enough of it! We were inspired and felt so good after being nourished for two weeks in balanced way that we continued cooking Ayurvedic meals back home. They organize cooking classes which are really helpful. I really enjoyed everyday yoga classes with great teacher Saila - her classes were awesome! Staff is amazing, helpful, friendly, smiling, always present and doing their job with heart. We felt so taken care of! Lakefront setting provides tranquil views. Just two-minute walk to amazing Arambol beach. Resort sprawls across five acres of lush greenery with private lake. Perfect blend of Goa's traditional architecture with modern comforts!

*"15-Day Detox Treatment - Excellent Results"*

Highly recommendable Ayurveda retreat in Goa. We did 15-day detox treatment and it was excellent! Food was fantastic - of course vegan, but never spicy. Nice center very well located, close to famous Arambol beach and good distance from its tumult. Hotel services top for the region. Unbeatable value for money. Everything done with spirit and taste. Food and daily Ayurveda care excellent. Staff very kind, smiling, attentive, and very professional. Atmosphere beautiful, joyful, and regenerating. Everything done for wellbeing of person and to make him live unique and unforgettable experience. Room clean, services superb, peaceful environment. Yoga classes excellent. Massages very good. Highlights of stay - Satvik food too delicious and healthy! Thank you VEDA5 for memorable stay, definitely come back again! The lakefront cottages provide serene views. Just short walk to Arambol beach for sunset viewing. Lush greenery surrounds property. Traditional Goan architecture combined with modern amenities!

*"Reset Button - Quiet and Peaceful Retreat"*

If you want to reset your system, VEDA5 is perfect place. Quiet and peaceful, short 35-minute traffic-free ride from Mopa airport. Staff very welcoming and hospitable - everyone wanting to ensure you're comfortable. Two doctors always available for consultation - be it Ayurveda or Naturopathy. All guest rooms overlook lake, spacious, clean, modern, well-maintained. I had very pleasant four-night stay. Food outstanding - wholesome, nutritious, plenty of variety for breakfast, lunch, dinner. Yoga classes very challenging for me, so I preferred participating only in daily Yoga Nidra classes. Therapies satisfactory. Would like to thank all staff from managers Mr. Pradip and Ms. Sita, doctors Dr. Dhanya and Dr. Ruchita, yoga teacher Mr. Yash, restaurant servers Sony, Arun, Kundan, and all others. Lake facing rooms provide constant tranquil views. Just minutes from Arambol beach. Perfect for health reasons - felt heard, supported, left with better understanding!

*"Pure Bliss - Perfect Mix of Everything"*

Pure bliss at VEDA5 Goa! Delightful resort including elements of relaxation, yoga, Ayurvedic treatments, amazing Satvik food cooked to perfection. VEDA5 in Arambol is perfect mix of what you need. Being so close to beach where you can hit shack and experience Goa vibe, watch magical sunsets is plus point. Care taken by Pradip the manager, Sony the hostess, Dr. Dhanya in-house physician, yoga teacher, therapists, pretty much everyone was amazing. Freshly cooked veg-based food simply great. Resort peaceful, housekeeping great. We felt at home and well looked after. Look forward to coming back for more. Will try their other resorts too. Well done VEDA5, please keep up great work - heaven! One hour from North Goa airport in small village, very peaceful generally. Lakefront cottages with beautiful views. Lush greenery surrounding property. Traditional architecture combined with modern luxury. Five acres of tranquil paradise!

*"Exceeded All Expectations - Transformative"*

VEDA5 Goa exceeded all expectations! Food absolutely outstanding - best healthy food I've ever had. Every meal fresh, beautifully presented, full of nourishing flavor leaving me satisfied and energized. Massages, yoga, meditation sessions deeply restorative - you truly feel care and expertise of team in every detail. Staff so warm, attentive, genuinely kind; made me feel completely at home and cared for from arrival. After stay, left feeling recharged, balanced, full - not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually. VEDA5 Goa more than retreat; it's transformative experience I can't recommend highly enough! The teacher truly exceptional, always taking time to guide and support each student with presence and kindness. Discovered Ayurvedic treatments first time - woman who looked after me amazing, therapies brought deep relaxation and healing. Entire staff incredibly kind, thoughtful, always smiling. Feel their priority is wellbeing and happiness of every guest. So grateful for experience, definitely come back!

*"Amazing Experience - Health Put on Top"*

Amazing experience at VEDA5 Goa - from treatments and food, through attentive friendly staff and beautiful onsite location, one-week stay more than expected. This was solo trip for health reasons. Felt heard, supported, left with better understanding of how eating and attitudes influence health and wellbeing. Yoga with Yash highlight of trip - diverse, challenging, with adjustments ensuring improvement. Never been pushed out of comfort zone like that before, all while remaining safe and motivated! Teacher not only accommodated many different abilities but showed authentic dedication to practice through Bhakti Yoga. Highly recommended experience! Wellness resort tranquil with lake facing views. Satvik food delicious. Ayurvedic treatments effective. Yoga teacher knowledgeable. Staff caring. Morning yoga sessions energizing. Cooking classes informative. Close to Arambol beach. Peaceful environment. Modern amenities. Clean rooms. Professional doctors. Genuine care throughout. Solo travelers feel safe and welcome!
