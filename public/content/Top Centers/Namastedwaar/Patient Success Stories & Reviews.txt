### Patient Success Stories & Reviews


**Review 1 - Meera Kapoor, New Delhi, India**

*"Wheelchair-Bound Arthritis Patient Walked Home!"*

I came to Namaste Dwaar wheelchair-bound with severe rheumatoid arthritis that conventional medicine couldn't help. After just 21 days of comprehensive Ayurvedic Panchakarma treatments, Vedic Acupressure therapy, and compassionate care from expert doctors, I walked out on my own feet! The transformation was miraculous. Dr. Sharma's expertise and daily monitoring adjusted treatments perfectly. Therapists were skilled and caring. The peaceful rural setting enhanced healing tremendously. Organic food was delicious and therapeutic. I'm forever grateful to Namaste Dwaar for giving me my life back!

*"Diabetes Control Without Increasing Medicines!"*

Struggled with uncontrolled diabetes for 8 years despite multiple medications. Namaste Dwaar holistic approach combining Ayurveda, Naturopathy, personalized diet, and lifestyle modifications brought my blood sugar to normal ranges within 14 days! Dr. Gupta reduced my medication gradually as treatments showed effects. Lost 7 kg weight naturally. The rural atmosphere, clean air, organic meals, and stress-free environment contributed significantly. Just 2 hours from Delhi makes it perfect for regular wellness visits. Highly recommend for lifestyle diseases!

*"Spiritual Wellness Retreat Beyond Expectations"*

Group of 32 people on spiritual wellness retreat stayed at Namaste Dwaar - the whole experience exceeded expectations! Rooms beautifully designed with attention to detail. Waking up to birds chirping, sitting in balcony overlooking lawns and sugarcane fields beyond was magical. Food made fresh from locally sourced produce delicious. The real USP - the people! From owners Arvind and Charul Rathi to front desk, restaurant staff, yoga teachers, housekeeping - everyone so helpful, taking great care with love and compassion. Reminded me of childhood holidays at grandparent's village. Cannot wait to return!

**Review 8 - Karan Khanna, Delhi, India**

*"Architecture Lover's Paradise with Wellness"*

As architecture enthusiast, I was blown away by late Pradeep Sachdeva's final masterpiece. The sustainable design, vernacular Uttar Pradesh elements, integration with natural surroundings - simply brilliant! But Namastedwaar isn't just beautiful architecture - the wellness offerings are comprehensive. Tried Ayurvedic massage, yoga classes, and loved the organic dining. Staff knowledge about medicinal herbs in garden impressive. The 4300 sq ft Machaan Lounge spectacular. Swimming pool area pristine. Just 2 hours from Delhi on excellent highway. Perfect combination of aesthetic beauty and holistic healing!

Suffered from chronic lower back pain for 5 years, tried countless doctors with temporary relief. Namaste Dwaar combination of authentic Ayurvedic treatments, Vedic Acupressure, and therapeutic yoga provided lasting relief! After 14 days, pain reduced 70%. Dr. Patel's expertise in identifying root cause rather than treating symptoms made difference. Therapists' skilled hands worked magic. Learned yoga postures and lifestyle modifications to maintain benefits. The peaceful rural setting, stress-free atmosphere, organic nutrition all contributed. So grateful for transformation. Highly recommend for chronic pain sufferers!
