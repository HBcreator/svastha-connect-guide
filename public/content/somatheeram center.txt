**Somatheeram Ayurvedic Health Resort - World's First Ayurveda Retreat, Kerala**


### About Somatheeram

Somatheeram Ayurvedic Health Resort is the world's first Ayurveda retreat established in 1990, pioneering the concept of authentic Ayurvedic healing combined with international hospitality standards. Located on the stunning Malabar Coast near Kovalam in Kerala, this legendary resort is nestled within a vast tropical garden spread across a scenic hillside with direct access to a pristine private beach. The name Somatheeram means temple of serenity, reflecting the resort's commitment to providing a peaceful environment conducive to deep healing and rejuvenation.

The resort comprises seventy traditional South Indian cottages and heritage houses, some dating back 300 years, meticulously restored while preserving their authentic charm. Managed by an experienced German-Indian team, Somatheeram perfectly blends Eastern healing wisdom with Western expectations of comfort and hygiene standards. Over 98 percent of guests report complete satisfaction with their Ayurveda treatments, and people from over 100 countries have experienced transformative healing at this remarkable wellness sanctuary.


### Accreditations & Recognition

Somatheeram has been awarded ten times as Best Ayurvedic Centre by the Government of Kerala since 1997, an unprecedented achievement that sets it apart from every other Ayurvedic facility in India. The resort has also received the prestigious National Tourism Award from the Government of India three consecutive times, acknowledging its pioneering role in promoting wellness tourism and India's ancient healing traditions to the global community.

Somatheeram is NABH accredited for Ayurveda, ensuring internationally recognized quality standards in healthcare services, patient safety, and clinical excellence. The resort has additionally received the Food Excellence Award for outstanding Ayurvedic vegetarian cuisine and Green Leaf Certification for environmental sustainability practices, demonstrating its holistic approach to wellness that extends beyond medical treatments.


### Treatment Philosophy & Approach

Somatheeram's unique strength lies in its dual management approach combining German organizational precision with Indian Ayurvedic expertise. The resort's thirteen highly qualified Ayurvedic physicians, led by renowned Dr. Raman who formerly served as Director of Ayurveda for Kerala state, specialize in treating Western diseases with traditional Ayurvedic methods.

Every guest undergoes a comprehensive initial consultation where doctors assess their constitution through pulse diagnosis, tongue examination, and detailed health history evaluation to identify doshic imbalances and design completely personalized treatment protocols. Unlike standardized spa treatments, authentic Ayurveda at Somatheeram addresses the root causes of illness rather than merely alleviating symptoms. Treatments are monitored daily and adjusted based on progress, ensuring optimal therapeutic outcomes. The resort maintains an in-house pharmaceutical facility producing approximately 225 authentic Ayurvedic medicines following traditional formulations, ensuring the purity, potency, and authenticity of all herbal preparations used in treatments.


### Systems of Medicine Practiced

**Ayurveda - Ancient Healing Science**

Ayurveda is an ancient traditional system of medicine considered to be the oldest system of healthcare, with literature going back 5000 years and an oral tradition that is much older.

At Somatheeram, authentic Panchakarma detoxification therapies are performed following classical Ayurvedic texts under the supervision of experienced physicians.
