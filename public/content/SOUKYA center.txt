### Systems of Medicine Practiced
**Ayurveda - Ancient Healing Science**
Ayurveda is an ancient traditional system of medicine considered to be the oldest system of healthcare, with literature going back 5000 years and an oral tradition that is much older. Ayurveda helps the healthy person maintain health and the diseased person regain health through natural therapies, herbal medicines, dietary modifications, and lifestyle changes.

**Homeopathy - Natural Remedies**
Homeopathy originated in 1796 in Germany and was discovered by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, a German scientist. Homeopathic medicines are derived from natural and herbal sources. A remedy chosen on the basis of a person's whole being including psychological, emotional, and hereditary information, instead of just an individual illness, will trigger the self-healing mechanism of the body.

**Yoga - Mind-Body Union**
The word Yoga comes from the Sanskrit word yuj meaning union, a union of the Mind, Body, and Spirit. It also embodies a union of one's self with the Universal Self, with the Supreme Spirit. This holistic science emphasizes that such a union is necessary for a person seeking good health and wellbeing.

**Naturopathy - Nature's Healing Power**

Naturopathy is a natural healing technique using the healing powers of nature. The principle of Naturopathy is that the accumulation of toxins is the root cause of all diseases, hence prevention of such accumulation and elimination of existing toxins is the route to health. Treatment includes dietary therapy, hydrotherapy, mud therapy, and fasting.
