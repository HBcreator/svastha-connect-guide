**Core Ayurvedic Therapies for Psoriasis**
The treatment plan is centered around a deep and thorough detoxification process using *Panchakarma*.

### Panchakarma: The Deep Detoxification
A customized *Panchakarma* protocol is essential for treating Psoriasis.
*   **Virechana (Medicated Purgation):** This is a cornerstone therapy for psoriasis. It is the most effective way to eliminate excess *Pitta dosha* and purify the blood and liver, directly addressing the inflammation.
*   **Vamana (Medicated Emesis):** In cases where *Kapha dosha* is predominant (with thick, itchy, oozing lesions), *Vamana* is used to cleanse the system.
*   **Rakta Mokshana (Bloodletting):** Using medicinal leeches (*Jalaukavacharana*) on the affected plaques is a highly effective way to remove localized, impure blood and reduce inflammation instantly.
*   **Basti (Medicated Enema):** Oil and decoction enemas are used to pacify the aggravated *Vata dosha*.

### External Therapies
*   **Lepam:** Application of thick herbal pastes made from herbs like turmeric and neem on the affected areas.
*   **Takradhara:** A unique and powerful therapy where medicated buttermilk is streamed continuously over the forehead. This is exceptionally effective for managing stress and is highly beneficial for scalp psoriasis.
*   **Abhyanga:** A gentle massage with specific medicated oils (like those containing Wrightia tinctoria or Chaulmoogra) helps to moisturize the skin and reduce scaling.

**The Critical Role of an Ayurvedic Diet (Pathya)**
Diet is non-negotiable in the treatment of Psoriasis.
**Foods to Favour**
*   Favour foods that are easy to digest and have a cooling effect.
*   Include plenty of bitter vegetables like bitter gourd, neem leaves, and leafy greens, as they are excellent for blood purification.
*   Grains like old rice, barley, and quinoa are recommended.

**Foods to Avoid**
*   **Strictly avoid** foods that aggravate *Pitta* and *Kapha*. This includes yogurt, dairy products, red meat, seafood, and black gram.
*   Avoid excessively sour, salty, and spicy foods.
*   Eliminate fermented foods, jaggery, and sesame seeds.
*   Avoid incompatible food combinations (e.g., milk with fish or sour fruits).

**Lifestyle Adjustments (Vihara)**
*   **Stress Management:** This is crucial. Practice regular meditation, yoga (*asanas*), and *pranayama* (breathing exercises) to keep stress levels in check.
*   **Avoid Harsh Soaps:** Use gentle, natural cleansers and keep the skin well-moisturized with coconut oil or prescribed medicated oils.
*   **Gentle Sun Exposure:** Moderate, gentle exposure to the morning sun can be beneficial.
*   **Avoid Scratching:** Keep nails short and resist the urge to scratch, as it can worsen the lesions.
