**Understanding the Panchakarma Process: Frequency and Safety**

This is a common and important question for anyone considering this powerful therapy.

### How Often Should You Do Panchakarma?

The ideal frequency of *Panchakarma* is highly personalized and depends on your age, health status, and goals. An Ayurvedic physician will provide the best recommendation, but here are some general guidelines:
