const faqItems = [
  { question: "Why does Ayurveda consider lower back pain a Vata disorder?", answer: "Vata dosha governs movement and is seated in the colon and lower back region. When aggravated by poor posture, stress, or dry foods, Vata 'dries out' the lubricating fluids in the spinal joints and causes the muscles to go into painful, rigid spasms." },
  { question: "What makes Kati Vasti different from a regular massage?", answer: "While a massage provides temporary surface relief, Kati Vasti involves retaining warm, medicated oil in a localized pool directly over the spine for an extended period (usually 30-45 minutes). This allows the herbs and heat to deeply penetrate and heal the spinal tissues." },
  { question: "Is Basti (enema therapy) really necessary for back pain?", answer: "Yes. Because the colon is the primary headquarters of Vata dosha, administering medicated oils rectally via Basti is the most direct and profound way to pacify systemic Vata. It calms the entire nervous system and nourishes the lower back from the inside out." },
  { question: "How long does the relief last after an Ayurveda Package?", answer: "Unlike painkillers which wear off in hours, Ayurveda aims to structurally heal the tissues. By completing a full Panchakarma protocol and following the prescribed dietary and postural lifestyle changes, patients often experience years of pain-free mobility." },
  { question: "Can stress really cause physical back pain?", answer: "Absolutely. Mental stress directly aggravates Vata dosha, leading to involuntary muscular tension, especially in the neck and lower back. This is why our holistic programs often incorporate Shirodhara and meditation alongside physical therapies." }
