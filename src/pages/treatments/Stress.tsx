const faqItems = [
  { question: "How does Ayurveda view stress differently from modern medicine?", answer: "Modern medicine often treats stress as purely psychological or treats symptoms with sedatives. Ayurveda views stress as a systemic imbalance (usually of Vata dosha) that affects both mind and body, physically drying out tissues and blocking subtle channels. We treat the physical roots of mental tension." },
  { question: "What exactly does Shirodhara do?", answer: "Shirodhara involves a continuous stream of warm oil on the forehead. This gentle pressure stimulates the pituitary and pineal glands, and significantly lowers cortisol levels. It shifts the autonomic nervous system from 'fight or flight' (sympathetic) into a deep state of 'rest and digest' (parasympathetic)." },
  { question: "Can a diet really help with anxiety?", answer: "Absolutely. In Ayurveda, 'like increases like'. Anxiety is light, erratic, and dry. Eating foods that are light, cold, and stimulating (like raw salads and caffeine) worsens it. Eating warm, heavy, grounding foods (like stews and ghee) physically grounds the nervous system." },
  { question: "Will I be prescribed Ayurvedic medications?", answer: "Yes. Depending on your specific imbalance (Vata, Pitta, or Kapha dominant stress), you may be given adaptogenic herbs like Ashwagandha, Brahmi, or Jatamansi to help your body adapt to stress and rebuild depleted energy reserves (Ojas)." },
  { question: "Is a 14-day program enough for severe burnout?", answer: "14 days is excellent for an initial reset and stopping the cycle of chronic stress. However, for severe burnout where vitality (Ojas) is deeply depleted, a 21 to 28-day program allows time for deep tissue nourishment and long-term structural recovery of the nervous system." }
