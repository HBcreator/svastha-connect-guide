const faqItems = [
  { question: "Why does Ayurveda consider menstrual pain a Vata disorder?", answer: "Menstruation relies on the downward flow of 'Apana Vata' in the pelvic region. When Vata is aggravated by stress, cold, or dry foods, its erratic nature disrupts this smooth flow, causing irregular, painful uterine contractions." },
  { question: "Is Basti (enema) necessary for treating menstrual pain?", answer: "Yes, Basti is considered the most profound and effective therapy for any Vata-related disorder. Administering medicated oils rectally brings healing directly to the pelvic region, calming the nerves and deeply lubricating the reproductive organs." },
  { question: "Can Ayurveda help with endometriosis-related pain?", answer: "Yes. Ayurveda treats endometriosis by addressing the specific doshic imbalances (often a mix of Vata and Pitta) that cause the painful tissue growth. Deep Panchakarma therapies like Virechana and specialized Basti can significantly reduce inflammation and pain." },
  { question: "How long does it take to see improvements in my cycle?", answer: "While some therapies provide immediate relief, lasting hormonal balance requires time. Most women notice a significant reduction in pain intensity and duration within 1 to 3 cycles following a comprehensive Panchakarma program." },
  { question: "Are herbal remedies like Ashoka safe?", answer: "Yes, traditional Ayurvedic herbs like Ashoka and Shatavari are safe and have been used for thousands of years as uterine tonics. They work gently to balance hormones and nourish the reproductive system without the severe side effects of synthetic hormones." }

              <p className="text-[#7F543D] leading-relaxed text-lg">
                In Ayurveda, painful menstruation is not a disease in itself, but a clear symptom of an underlying imbalance, primarily of the <strong className="text-[#335765]">Vata dosha</strong>. Specifically, it involves <strong className="text-[#335765]">Apana Vata</strong>, the downward-moving energy in the pelvic region.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#7F543D] leading-relaxed text-lg">
                When Vata is aggravated by stress, erratic lifestyle, or cold foods, its dry and erratic nature disrupts the smooth downward flow. This causes the uterine muscles to contract irregularly and painfully, leading to severe cramps. Ayurveda restores this natural flow for a pain-free cycle.
