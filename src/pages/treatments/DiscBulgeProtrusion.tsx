const faqItems = [
  { question: "Why does Ayurveda associate a disc bulge with Vata Dosha?", answer: "Vata represents movement, dryness, and degeneration. When aggravated, it 'dries out' the intervertebral discs, causing them to lose their fluid cushioning and bulge outward. It also weakens the supporting muscles and causes the radiating nerve pain." },
  { question: "Can Kati Vasti really help if the disc is already bulging?", answer: "Yes. Kati Vasti creates a pool of warm, medicated oil directly over the affected vertebrae. This sustained heat and oil deeply penetrate the tissues, relaxing severe muscle spasms, lubricating the dehydrated disc, and significantly relieving nerve compression pain." },
  { question: "How does Basti (enema) help my spine?", answer: "The colon is the 'home seat' of Vata dosha. Administering medicated oils via Basti is the fastest and most profound way to pacify systemic Vata. It calms the entire nervous system, reduces pain signals, and nourishes the bone tissue (Asthi Dhatu) throughout the body." },
  { question: "Can this treatment help me avoid spinal surgery?", answer: "For many patients, yes. Ayurveda offers a powerful, non-invasive alternative that treats the root cause—disc dehydration and muscle weakness—rather than just cutting away the bulging tissue. Many of our patients successfully avoid surgery after a comprehensive 21-28 day program." },
  { question: "Why are gas-forming foods restricted?", answer: "Foods like beans or raw cabbage create gas in the large intestine. This excess gas pushes upward and outward, increasing intra-abdominal pressure, which directly presses against the already vulnerable lumbar spine, worsening the pain." }
