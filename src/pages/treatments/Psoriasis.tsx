The Ayurvedic program treated both as expressions of the same Vata-Rakta systemic imbalance.

const faqItems = [
  { question: "Is Ayurveda effective for severe plaque psoriasis?", answer: "Yes, Ayurveda is highly effective even for chronic plaque psoriasis. By addressing the 'Rakta' (blood) and 'Pitta' (inflammatory) components through Panchakarma, we can achieve deep and lasting skin clearance." },
  { question: "How long does it take to see results?", answer: "Most patients begin to see a visible reduction in redness and scaling within the first 7 to 10 days of the detox program." },
  { question: "Will I have to stay on herbal medicines forever?", answer: "No. The goal of the intensive program in India is to reset your system. Once remission is achieved, you will move to a maintenance diet and lifestyle with minimal or no internal medicine." },
  { question: "Does the treatment address Psoriatic Arthritis?", answer: "Yes. Ayurveda treats the skin and joints as a single systemic imbalance. The Panchakarma program, specifically Basti enemas, is excellent for reducing joint inflammation while the detox addresses the skin." },
  { question: "Can the treatment be done alongside biologics?", answer: "Yes, many patients come to our centers while on biologics. Our Vaidyas can design a program that works safely alongside your current medications while working towards reducing your dependence on them." }
