The retreat blends a relaxed beach-town atmosphere with a genuine in-house Ayurvedic spa, making it a natural choice for travellers who want daily massage and yoga without giving up easy access to the beach, cafes, and Arambol's famous sunset point.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The property is built around a quiet garden and pool that sit just behind the beach road, giving guests a calm space to rest between therapies without straying far from the water. Rooms stay simple and airy rather than over-styled, which fits the overall philosophy here: let the Ayurveda, the yoga, and the beach do the work, without unnecessary distractions getting in the way of real rest.

                    Each stay is built around a simple daily rhythm: guided morning or evening yoga, a personalised Ayurvedic massage such as Abhyanga or Shirodhara, and unhurried time in the garden and pool area between sessions. Therapists take time to understand individual stress levels and body constitution before recommending a therapy plan, rather than offering a one-size-fits-all spa menu. Combined with a 24-hour front desk and assistance with airport transfers, it's designed to feel effortless from arrival to departure.
